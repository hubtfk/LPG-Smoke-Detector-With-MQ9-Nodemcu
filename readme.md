Gas Detection System with Buzzer
This Arduino project detects the presence of gas using a gas sensor and activates a buzzer when the gas concentration exceeds a predefined threshold.

Circuit Connections
•Buzzer Pin (D8): Connect the positive (longer) leg of the       buzzer to D8 on the Arduino and the negative (shorter) leg to the ground (GND) pin.

•Gas Sensor Pin (A0): Connect the gas sensor to A0 on the Arduino.

  int gasThreshold = 300;

Make sure to connect the components as described above. Adjust the gasThreshold value in the code to suit your specific gas concentration threshold.
